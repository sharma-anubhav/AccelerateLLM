But what exactly is AI, and how is it transforming our world? In this article, we\u2019ll explore the basics of AI, its applications, and its impact on society.\nWhat is AI?\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems can be designed to mimic human behavior"
